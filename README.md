<h2>TinkerHub Saturday HackNight - Budget Planner</h2>

As part of the Saturday Hacknight organised by Tinkerhub, we created a Budget Planner, where you can track your monthly expenses and income. This React app retrieves data enterd in Notion using **Notion API**. 

## Background
A personal or household budget is a summary that compares and tracks your income and expenses for a defined period, typically one month. Most people tend to spend money unaware of their budget and is often left with empty hands by month-end. A budget planner can help us visualise our monthly expense and income and lets us spend wisely.
